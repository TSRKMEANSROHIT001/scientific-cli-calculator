# Scientific CLI Calculator (ECE Oriented)

A Linux-based **Scientific Command-Line Calculator** written in C, designed with
**Electronics & Communication Engineering (ECE)** use-cases in mind.

This project demonstrates:
- Linux CLI utility design
- Safe floating-point parsing
- Scientific math functions
- DSP helpers
- Ohm’s Law calculations
- CMake-based build system
